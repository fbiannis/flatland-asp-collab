The **infLoop** test map is an *unsolvable* flatland environment.

## Design

<img height="200px" src="https://i.ibb.co/2YV0bYw/infLoop.png">

The map is **static** (its form is as is; not to be altered/expanded) and has one agent.


### Info:

**Green circles** indicate possible starting or ending points within the environment.

## Testing

The environment serves the purposes of testing how **ASP** implementations handle *solvability*.
